_____

A basic dynamic template handler that allows for the insertion of dynamic data into static HTML templates.

1. Clone this repository or download the files to your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where the app.js file is located in a terminal window.
3. Run the app by running the following command:
        `node app.js`
4. You will be prompted to enter the path to the template file and the path to the data file. Enter the paths to your own files or already existing ones:

        Path to template file: html/template.html
        Path to data file: data/data.json
After entering these paths, if paths are correct the server will start.
You can access the rendered HTML page by going to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.
